# Indian Medicinal Plant Detection

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to identify Indian medicinal plants. Given an image of a plant, the model predicts the plant's name and provides additional information such as its botanical name, family, uses, and properties. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow, and the current version recognizes 40 medicinal plant species.

Currently the model has limitations due to the current dataset and accuracy, it is designed to be improved in the future by adding more plant classes and refining the prediction algorithm for better performance.


## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload an image of a plant, and the model will predict the plant's name.
- **Predictions:** The model provides the predicted class along with the botanical name, plant family, description, and common uses of the plant.
- **Future Enhancements:** Additional plant classes will be added in future updates, and the accuracy of predictions will be improved by expanding the dataset.


## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed along with the required libraries.
